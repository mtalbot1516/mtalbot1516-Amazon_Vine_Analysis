## Summary
### It seems as though some bias was given to the reviews in the vine program. The Vine program received a higher percentage of 5 star reviews but only by 4.5%. However, it is unclear if this result is statistically signifant. To delve further into the significance of this result, I would create a hypothesis ans do a one sample t-test with the data. This should give us a clear cut answer into the results.
